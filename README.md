# Campus
A personal learning project to fill in gaps in my knowledge.

## Courses
- [MPM2D1](https://github.com/calebjolliffe/campus/tree/main/mpm2d1)
- [MCR3U1]()

## Logic
Many of the courses required to enroll in a software engineering or related program at the post-secondary level were not available to me while I was in high school. Now that I am beyond high school and post-secondary, I am aiming to fill in my knowledge gaps so that I can pursue my original dream of becoming a software engineer.
